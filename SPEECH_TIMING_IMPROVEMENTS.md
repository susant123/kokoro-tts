# Speech Recognition Timing Improvements

## Changes Made

### 🕐 **Increased Silence Threshold**
- **Before**: 1.5 seconds of silence before submitting
- **After**: 2.0 seconds of silence before submitting
- **Impact**: More time to pause naturally during speech without triggering submission

### 🧠 **Smarter Processing Logic**
1. **Content Length Check**: Only processes speech with more than 3 characters
2. **Substantial Speech**: Only processes speech with more than 2 characters when final
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents processing if already processing a result
4. **Better Timeout Management**: Separate timeouts for interim and final results

### 🎯 **Enhanced Voice Activity Detection**
- **Interim Results**: Shows "Keep talking or pause 2 seconds to send..." during active speech
- **Final Results**: Small 300ms delay to allow for potential continuation
- **Auto-Stop**: Stops recognition when processing begins to prevent conflicts

### 📱 **Improved User Feedback**
- **Initial Message**: "Click microphone → speak → pause 2 seconds to send"
- **During Speech**: "Keep talking or pause 2 seconds to send..."
- **Continuous Mode**: "Continuous mode enabled - will keep listening after 2-second pause"
- **Single Mode**: "Single-shot mode - pause 2 seconds to send, or click mic"

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
- **Duplicate Timeouts**: Prevents multiple timers from conflicting
- **Length Validation**: Avoids processing very short utterances
- **State Management**: Better tracking of processing state
- **Cleanup**: Proper timeout clearing to prevent memory leaks

## Expected Behavior Now

### ✅ **Better Speech Handling**
1. **Start Speaking**: Click microphone, see "Listening..."
2. **Continue Speaking**: Status shows "Keep talking or pause 2 seconds to send..."
3. **Natural Pauses**: Short pauses (< 2 seconds) won't trigger submission
4. **Completion**: Pause for 2 full seconds to automatically send
5. **Manual Stop**: Click microphone anytime to stop and send immediately

### 🎯 **Use Cases Fixed**
- **Long Sentences**: Won't get cut off mid-sentence
- **Thinking Pauses**: Can pause briefly to think without triggering send
- **Complex Thoughts**: Can express multi-part ideas without interruption
- **Natural Speech**: Mimics natural conversation rhythm better

### 📊 **Timing Summary**
- **Minimum Speech Length**: 3+ characters for interim, 2+ for final
- **Silence Threshold**: 2.0 seconds for auto-submission
- **Final Result Delay**: 300ms buffer for browser-detected completion
- **Processing Prevention**: No new input while processing current speech

This should give you a much more natural speech experience where you can speak complete thoughts without worrying about premature submission!
